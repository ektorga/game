              <p class="uy">Fortnite is an online video game developed
                 by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available
                 in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise 
                 share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite 
                 Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in which up
                 to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; Fortnite:
                 Save the World,<br/> a cooperative hybrid tower defense-shooter and
                 survival game in which up to four players fight off zombie-like
                 creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they 
                 can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given 
                 complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas.<br/>
                 Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017
                 as early access titles, while Creative was released
                 on December 6, 2018. While the Save the World and Creative
                 versions have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle
                 Royale in particular became an overwhelming success and a cultural
                 phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in less than a year,
                 earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month.
                 Fortnite as a whole generated $9 billion in gross
                 revenue up until December 2019.                
                 Save the World is available only for Windows,
                 macOS,[b] PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, while
                 Battle Royale and Creative were released for
                 all those platforms, and also for Nintendo 
                 Switch, iOS,[b] and Android devices.[b] The
                 game also launched with the release of the 
                 next-generation PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles. </p>

            Call of Duty: Warzone is a free-to-play battle royale video game 
            released on March 10, 2020, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft
            Windows. A version for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S has been
            announced to be released in 2022, with a mobile version also in development 
            as of 2022.[1][2] The game is a part of 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 
            and is connected to 2020's Call of Duty: Black Ops: Cold War and 2021's Call
            of Duty: Vanguard, but does not require purchase of any of the aforementioned 
            titles, and was introduced during Season 2 of Modern Warfare content. Warzone 
            was developed by Infinity Ward and Raven Software (the latter later credited as
            the sole developer following the integration of Cold War's content) and published 
            by Activision.[3] Warzone allows online multiplayer combat among 150 players, 
            although some limited-time game modes support 200 players. The game features
            both cross-platform play and cross-platform progression between the three
            aforementioned titles.
            At launch, the game features two main modes: Battle Royale and Plunder. Warzone introduces a 
            new in-game currency system that can be used at "Buy Stations" in and around the map. "Loadout" 
            drops are an example of where Cash can be traded for limited access to players' custom classes
            (which were shared with Modern Warfare's standard modes prior to Season 6, v1.29, but now are
            unique to Warzone). Players may also use Cash to purchase items such as "killstreaks" and gas
            masks. Cash can be found by looting buildings
            and killing players that have cash on them. 
            At launch, Warzone only offered Trios, a squad 
            capacity of three players. However, in free post-launch 
            content updates, Solos, Duos and Quads have all been added 
            to the game.
            The game received generally positive reviews from critics, with the maps receiving 
            specific praise. In April 2021, Activision announced that Warzone had surpassed 100
            million active players

            Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale-hero
            shooter game developed by Respawn Entertainment 
            and published by Electronic Arts. It was released
            for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox 
            One in February 2019, for Nintendo Switch in
            March 2021, and for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series
            X/S in March 2022. A mobile version of the game 
            designed for touchscreens titled Apex Legends
            Mobile was released in May 2022 on Android and
            iOS. The game supports cross-platform play,
            excluding the aforementioned mobile platforms.
            Before the match, players form into two- or three-player squads,
            and select from pre-designed characters with distinctive
            abilities, known as "Legends". The game has two gameplay
            modes. In "Battle Royale", up to 20 three-person squads
            or 30 two-person duos land on an island and search for
            weapons and supplies before attempting to defeat all 
            other players in combat. The available play area on the
            island shrinks over time, forcing players to keep moving
            or else find themselves outside the play area which can
            be fatal. The final team alive wins the round. In "Arenas", 
            players form into three-player squads and fight against
            another squad in a 3v3 team deathmatch over a series of
            rounds to determine the winner of the match. Teams win
            when their team has at least 3 points and is 2 points ahead.

          <p class="ret">
            Red Dead Redemption 2[a] is a 2018 
            action-adventure game developed and
            published by Rockstar Games. The game 
            is the third entry in the Red Dead series
            and a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead
            Redemption. The story is set in 1899              
            and follows the exploits of outlaw
            Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van 
            der Linde gang, in a fictionalized
            representation of the Western, Midwestern,
            and Southern United States. Arthur must 
            deal with the decline of the Wild West 
            whilst attempting to survive against
            government forces, rival gangs, and other 
            adversaries. The game's epilogue follows
            fellow gang member John Marston, 
            the protagonist of Red Dead Redemption.
            The game is presented through both first
            and third-person perspectives, and the player
            may freely roam in its interactive open world
            . Gameplay elements include shootouts, heists, 
            hunting, horseback riding, interacting with non-player              
            haracters, and maintaining the character's honor rating
            through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system similar
            to the "wanted" system from the Grand Theft Auto
            franchise governs the response of law enforcement 
            and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player. 
            Red Dead Online, the game's online multiplayer mode,
            lets up to 32 players engage in a variety of
            cooperative and competitive game modes.            
            The game's development lasted over eight years,
            beginning soon after Red Dead Redemption's release,
            and it became one of the most expensive video games
            ever made. Rockstar co-opted all of its studios into
            one large team to facilitate development. They drew
            influence from real locations as opposed to film or
            art, focused on creating an accurate reflection of
            the time with the game's characters and world. Th                   e
            game was Rockstar's first built specifically for
            eighth generation consoles, having tested their
            technical capabilities while porting Grand Theft
            Auto V to the platforms. The game's soundtrack
            features an original score composed by Woody
            Jackson and several vocal tracks produced                          
            by Daniel Lanois. Red Dead Redemption 2 was
            released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
            in October 2018, and for Windows and Stadia
            in November 2019.               
            Widely anticipated and marketed before release,
            Red Dead Redemption 2 broke several records and 
            had the second-biggest launch in the history of 
            entertainment, generating US$725 million in sales 
            from its opening weekend and exceeding the lifetime
            sales of Red Dead Redemption in two weeks. It received
             critical 
            acclaim, with praise directed at its story,characters, 
            open world, graphics, music, and level of detail; some
            criticism was directed at its control scheme and emphasis
            on realism over player freedom. Considered an example of                 
            video games as an art form as well as one of the greatest
            video games ever made, it won year-end accolades includingGame 
            of the Year awards from several gaming publications.
            It is also among the best-selling video games with over
            44 million copies shipped.
